Hello! I'm not 100% sure how a readme should be written yet, but here is a breif explanation of how to use this app

SEARCH
*Enter the name of a Song, Album, or Artist that you want to look up in Spotify.
*Click search when you are ready. You will be redirected if you are not already logged in to Spotify
*When the search completes, you can scroll through a list of matched songs in the Results panel

ADD TO PLAYLIST
*Click the "+" button next to any song in the results panel to add it to a new playlist
*The current lists of songs in your new playlist are displayed on the playlists panel
*Change the name of your new playlist by changing updating the header above the input panel
*To remove a song from your playlist, click the "-" button next to that song on the playlist panel
*When you are ready to save, click the "Save to Spotify" button at the bottom of the playlist panel
*This will create a new playlist in your Spotify account with the name and songs that you selected

CURRENT PLAYLISTS
*Underneath the Results and Playlist panels, jammming will load a list of your current playlists saved on Spotify
*Click on any playlist name in the "My Playlists" panel to load the songs from your playlist into the playlist panel
*From here, you can add or remove any songs you want as described above, then create a new playlist for your Spotify account
*NOTE changing the tracks on your playlist will not change the existing playlist in your Spotify, it will create an entirely new playlist
